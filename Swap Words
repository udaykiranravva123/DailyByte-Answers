Given a string s, reverse the words.
Note: You may assume that there are no leading or trailing whitespaces and each word within s is only separated by a single whitespace.

Ex: Given the following string sâ€¦

s = "The Daily Byte", return "Byte Daily The".


SOLUTION:

inputStr = input() # Taking Input From User
inputList = inputStr.split(' ') # Spliting The Sentence Into Words
inputList = inputList[::-1] # reversing list
reversedString = " ".join(inputList) # Joining the reversed inputList
print(reversedString) #Printing the Reversed String
